Welcome to my blog! I'm excited to share my thoughts and experiences with you. This first post will demonstrate some of the features available in my blog system.

## Getting Started

This blog is built with Next.js and MDX, which allows me to write content using Markdown while also embedding React components directly in my posts.

## Code Highlighting

Here's an example of code highlighting using Shiki:

```ts utils.ts
function greet(name: string): string {
	return `Hello, ${name}! Welcome to my blog.`
}

const message = greet('Reader')
console.log(message)
```

And here's another example without a filename:

```js
const example = 'No filename shown here'
console.log(example)
```

The syntax highlighting is powered by Shiki, which uses the same TextMate grammar engine as VS Code, ensuring accurate and beautiful code highlighting.

## Interactive Components

One of the cool features of MDX is that I can embed React components directly in my blog posts. Here's a simple counter component:

<Counter />

Try clicking the buttons to interact with it!

## Images

I can also include images in my blog posts. Here's a photo:

## Conclusion

This is just the beginning. I'll be sharing more posts about web development, React, TypeScript, and other topics that interest me. Stay tuned!
